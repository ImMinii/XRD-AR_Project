# Reflections - Simon
I’ve had a bit of experience when it comes to XR development prior to this course, and I am also working with Julie and Maja in a bachelor project where we are developing a VR simulation for Horsens hospital. Having this knowledge and working parallel with the bachelor project helps a lot but the greatest difficulty is developing something that makes practical sense. It’s easy for myself to move around in the different XR applications, but not everyone is used to the technology, and doesn’t know the limitations of the hardware. Especially in VR. VR Hardware has come far since last time i had personally a lot of interest in it. I have an old Oculus Rift myself. Going from outside-in to inside-out was amazing. Having a wireless headset that basically plug and play and not having the hassle to setup sensors and a wire from the computer to the headset, is a far better experience because it feels like you are able to move around more freely. When it comes to AR I worked a bit on it in 5th semester and researched a lot about it at that time so I had a lot of background knowledge prior to the course about the difficulties of AR development and what limitations it has. VR is a bit simpler that way. You can create a virtual world for the user but in AR you have to create something that coexists with the real world, so some of the biggest problems are how you correctly place the virtual objects correctly into the envoirment and the whole occlusion problem. If the environment has something in front of the virtual object.

### AR Project
The first project our group and I created was a tabletop application. My focus on this project was setting up the XR Origin (AR rig) and creating the terrain, including functionality for splitting it in half. We were using my phone to build the application. Luckily for us this type of project was fairly easy. What I mean by that is that we didn’t have to think about occlusion. As it is a bit more in a dynamic sense that the terrain can be placed wherever you choose and it doesn’t make that much sense that you should place it where the environment gets in front of the terrain. And modern phones are fairly good at tracking 6DoF relative to the placed object so we didn’t need to set up a QR code for placing the terrain.
I used a lot of the time in this project in blender. This was my first time using blender and it took some time to get used to. I properly didn’t create the terrain in the most practical way. I created a base from a cube and then layer after layer I extended and scaled the next layer smaller. To create a bit of depth in the top I set a lot of vertexes and pushed them a bit down.

There might have been an easier way to create this but it might have taken longer and there wasn’t a lot of time
To create the functionality of looking inside this terrain I duplicated the terrain and split it in half. In unity i created a script that hides an object by a button. So in the application there is a complete and a half object placed. When the button is clicked it hides the complete object so you are able to see the layers inside with the half object. This was the solution that made the most sense for me.

### VR project
The second project was a small co-op puzzle/escape game. My focus in this was on the secondary screen and security cameras. Here I also setup the VR headset in Unity and all the testing was on my PC. This was a really fun project and I wished we had more time for it. I chose the functionality for the secondary screen because it seemed really interesting to use more than one screen on a pc. This was done by having a dedicated canvas on display 2 and then we were able to put the different features in this canvas. This display also had a small script that activated the display when starting the game with the “MonitorDisplay” script.
For controlling the security cameras I chose to have buttons to swap around. This could have been done differently but i chose to have it so the buttons on a map, so the player knows which camera they are choosing. In this map it was still confusing to go around because they didn’t know where the player started. It could maybe have been made so the player also could see where the VR player was. Another issue with these cameras is that I added greyscaling on it. Which was fine for the camera effect but it was a bit too difficult to distinguish between the enemy and the player since the primary difference was the color. However a simple solution could just give them a gun instead of something complicated. What I mostly learned when developing this was playing around with different cameras in one scene. Having the different render textures and displaying them in one raw image while being able to swap around the different render textures.
