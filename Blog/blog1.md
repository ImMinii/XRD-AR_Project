# Blog 1 – XR introduction

Authors: Julie, Maja, Simon, Rune

Extended reality (XR) is the big umbrella term for AR/VR/MR, where the most well
known terms are Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR). Then there is
MR which is somewhere in between with a mix of both AR and VR. It can visually
be shown with the following graph:

On the left side you have reality, where closely there is AR. From this
perspective, a short explanation of what AR is, is that it’s close to reality,
but there are virtual objects that coexist with the real world. On the right
side, you have virtual and VR. Here the difference lies in that it becomes VR,
when you are able to immerse the user in a virtual environment, and give the
feeling of being present in this environment. In-between there is MR which is a
bit of a grey area. It’s a bit of both and there is no exact hard line where
it changes from AR/VR to MR. One explanation of it is that both real and virtual
realities create a new environment with both digital and physical objects
coexist and interacts in real time.

The practical use of XR is interesting, because until now it’s either the real
world on a virtual world through a computer. With XR you mix it, and tailor it
to a case. Whether it’s more commercial fun, with gaming and simulation or if
it’s more business/educational, with learning and training. You are able to
think and see the world from another perspective, because in the real world you
have limitations on what can actually be created, while on a compiler screen you
don’t have the sense of reality of the objects in the screen’s 2D space. In
XR you can start breaking these barriers. With AR you can start having virtual
objects that could potentially aid you, like giving directions, showing
electrical cables or pipes in a building, or the classic facefilters from
snapchat. With VR you can simulate a whole new world and interact with it.
Whether it’s a training simulation or a fictional game such as a zombie
shooter. The use of XR has endless possibilities. Some great examples of use
cases in this could be from the company Virsabi. They have a lot of cases
working with companies. For example Normal that have a VR training simulation
for their warehouse, or Louis Poulsen that has an AR product visualizer for your
phone and much more. On the commercial side then, Valve has the game Half-life:
Alyx, where you immerse yourself in the well-known half-life world, or something
simpler like beat saber where you slash blocks to music.
